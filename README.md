# Movie ranking website

This is day 64 project from an online Python bootcamp: 100 days of code by Angela Yu.
It's a Flask web application that allows users to view a list of movies, rate and review them, and add new movies to the database. It utilizes the TMDB API to fetch movie data.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/lukaszminor23/movie-ranking-website.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   
3. Set up your TMDB API key by replacing `"Your API key"` in the `API_KEY` variable in `main.py` file with your actual API key.


4. Run the application:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```
5. Access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000/` in your web browser.
